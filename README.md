# redshift
Read from a Redis list and fan out to many endpoints. Complementary to [blueshift](https://github.com/andrew-sledge/blueshift).

## TODOS
* Finish sends/mail endpoint.
* Finish sends/slack endpoint for chatops.
* Group::source level configuration instead of just group level configuration.
* Redis cluster/non-cluster modes (right now just in cluster mode)
* Probably more stuff.
